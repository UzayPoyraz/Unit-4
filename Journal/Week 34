* Reflections:

-G12 IA Video:
Picking a client can be either local or I can search for a company to work with.

There are many ways to do the project. It does not necessarily have to be in programing languages we know.

First two criteria are relatively easier than 3, so get help when it comes to development.

Talk to your client to get evidence.

Make clear goals and success criterias in the beginning.

Development should be start early to match all of the success criteria.

Don't make it unnecessarily complicated and don't leave it for late time

Look around you for problems. 

Find something interesting since I will spend a lot of time on it.
* Computer Networks summary:
Early networks were too large and expensive. Small networks called LANs were popular. for these LANs to transform information, ethernet was used.
Ethernet is bunch of computers connected to eachother with physical cabels. To distinguish the computers MAC addresses are used. 
The problem with ethernet is when two computers write data at the same time and if they write at the same time collusuion occurs. To 
prevent this computers wait randomly wait before writing. The more the collusion, the more the computer waits. Instead of this, there can be
many collutions domains there can be more transmissions at the same time so it prevents collution. Message switching: there are many stops
at the route so there are many ways the information passed to another place. When a big file is transfered, it creates a problem. the small
file has to wait the big file to complete transmission. This can be prevented by seperating it into small packets. It is like series of tubes.
