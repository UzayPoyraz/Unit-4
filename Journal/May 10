Today was all about web designing.
First I learned Html and CSS from scratch and learned couple of functions I can use for a website.
I did the course until where I was required so I was ready to develope my first website.
I used w3school.com for all of my code. I started a design of my own website where I write information about myself
while using everything I learned from the Khan Academy courses. It took me a bit of time but compared to the information I learned,
it is not even mentionable.

Compared to the other coding languages I have learnt before, this is significantly different.
